# 🧩 Mini Project (BEGINNER — 45 minutes)

# ⭐ "Simple Personal Greeting Webpage"

### 📌 1. Problem Statement

Create a very simple webpage (index.html) that displays a greeting and your name.
Use Git to track versions, create branches, merge changes, and push to GitHub.

This project is easy, clean, and fast — perfect for practice.

### 📄 2. Description

You will build a basic HTML page with:

A heading

Paragraph about yourself

A colors section

A hobbies section

You will NOT focus on coding.
You will focus entirely on Git workflow with small, easy edits.

### 📦 3. What You Will Practice

In just one small project, you will cover:

✔ git init
✔ git add, git commit
✔ branching
✔ merging
✔ a tiny merge conflict
✔ push to GitHub
✔ basic PR (optional)

Nothing advanced.
Nothing complex.
Everything doable in 30–45 minutes.
